## Sample Dataset 

This sample dataset was generated by ChatGPT and it is stored in `dataset.txt`

```
ID,Name,Department,Salary,HireDate

1002,Bob Smith,Sales,56000,2018-09-15
1003,Carol White,Engineering,92000,2013-11-02
1004,David Lee,HR,61000,2017-04-28
1005,Ella Green,Marketing,71000,2016-12-01
1006,Frank Black,Sales,58000,2020-01-12
1007,Gina Lopez,HR,64500,2014-08-19

## Commands

Print out dataset with a page header

```
awk '
BEGIN {
	printf "\n\n"
	printf "Checkout my sample dataset\n"
	printf "----------------------------\n"
}
{print}
END {
	printf "-------------------------------\n"
	printf "Footer Text\n\n"
}' \ 
dataset.txt
```

Print out just column 2 (names column) and skip the header row

- `-F,` specifies the comma delimeter
- `NR > 1` skips the header line
- `$2` is the column number which corresponds to the "Name" column

```
awk -F, 'NR > 1 {print $2}' dataset.txt
```

Add a total number of rows

```
awk -F, '
BEGIN {printf "\n"}
NR > 1 {print $2; count++}
END {print "Total Names: ", count, "\n"}
' dataset.txt
```

Use a awk command file. The `print-full-list.awk` is in the repo and just
contains the first command example from above.

```
awk -f print-full-list.awk dataset.txt
```

Filter for a Specific name

```
awk -F, -v name="Hank Kim" '$2 == name' dataset.txt
```

Return the row if $2 contains the name and it does not have to be an exact match

- `index` is like the indexOf function where if name exists within $2 it will return the index of where it is in the string.

```
awk -F, -v name="Hank" 'index($2, name)' dataset.txt
```
